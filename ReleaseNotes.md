- Made all scripts (except odysseyra1n) POSIX compliant
- Switched from Bash to Dash because it's roughly 4x times faster according to the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dash) (sh is a symlink to Dash on Debian) 
- Slightly improved UI (menus resize to fit the screen, logos are centered, changed startup message, fixed shutdown logo)
- ISOs are smaller (about 15 MB less)
